# Lesson 1

## Summary
Today we covered the parts of a computer, how they work together, and why they are necessary.  
We also discussed why it is important to understand these components and what we, as programmers, need to consider.  
Additionally, we completed many practical exercises involving `System.out`, `Scanner`, and `random`.  
These will be essential for Assignment 1.

### Key Takeaways
We live in an era where memory has been a cheap resource, and we've been spoiled with seemingly infinite access to it.  
However, this has indirectly become more expensive as many are now venturing into the cloud.  
Platforms like AWS, Azure, and similar services charge for clock cycles and memory usage.  
Therefore, we should start developing an awareness, as developers, of writing efficient and sustainable code early on.  
While we didn’t delve deeply into this topic, we will touch upon it in upcoming lessons.

### Practical Exercise
Today's session was largely focused on practical exercises, combined with some theory.  
The structure moving forward will be similar to today.  
For me, it is important that you actively participate and engage with the code practically, rather than just listening to theory and seeing examples.

### Upcoming Lessons
In the upcoming lessons, we will cover variables and types.  
This will include further exploration of memory and memory management.  
We will also continue with methods and loops this week.

### The Assignment
The assignment due next Monday was introduced today. ***Do not stress!***  
This is just the first lesson, and it is ***not*** expected that you solve the task right away.  
HOWEVER, it is a good idea to start working on it so you can ask questions and receive guidance in time.  
We will go through the remaining material necessary to complete the task before the end of the week.

### In Conclusion
Thank you for today! It was fantastic to join a class with such great enthusiasm and openness for discussion.  
I appreciate feedback on today's lesson, and you’re welcome to email me your thoughts.  
Feel free to share if you think the structure could benefit from changes.  
Everyone learns differently, and my goal is to reach all of you.

Great work!
